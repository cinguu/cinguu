  This project was made so UNCC students had a way to sell their new and used books, dorm items, and etc. Students can create an account, post a listing, and contact other students to buy items.

  This is a website advertising a local nail salon. It has a welcome, contact, list of services, and gallery page for incoming customers to look at.
